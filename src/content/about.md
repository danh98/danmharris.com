### Homelab
I've always been interested in the deployment and management of medium to large scale networks. This ranges from things such as virtualisation and hypervisors to automation and configuration management through tools such as Ansible. I aim to build a network like this in a home environment, which I will document on [my blog](/posts).

### Linux
I would consider myself a Linux advocate, having used it since 2009 and as a main operating system since 2018. I also try to use open source software wherever possible. My current distro is Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with stock GNOME 3 as the desktop environment, however I have used distros such as Debian, Fedora, Arch and OpenSUSE in the past.
