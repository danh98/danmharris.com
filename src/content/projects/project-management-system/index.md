Completed as a cloud application coursework, this project consists of two parts. First is a backend which is written as AWS Lamba serverless functions, which present a REST API through an API gateway. These functions communicate with various other AWS services such as Cognito (identity mangement) and Dynamo (database).

In addition there is a frontend written as a React single page application, utilising various libraries to communicate effectively with the backend.
