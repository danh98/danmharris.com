<div class="content-body">
    <p>I have been using Windows all my life but after using Ubuntu 9.04 in 2009, I have had an interest in trying out various Linux distributions, because of what variety there is between them. I have the intent on eventually using it as my main operating system, due to the advantages it has over the Windows platform. </p>

<p>One of my main interests in computing for the past few years has been in servers. Here I have experimented with various pieces of software on both Windows and Linux, such as configuration management, DNS, E-Mail etc. Soon I will begin to venture into other areas of networking such as routing and VLANs.
