	<p>Hello, my name is Dan Harris and I am an 18 year old technology enthusiast. I have had an interest in computing for the last 8 years and am planning to pursue a career in the industry. I have just completed studying A-Levels in Computing, Maths and Physics where I got results of A*A*A respectively. I also have an AS in Further Maths and Geography (Both at A grade). These results have earned me a place on a Computer Science course at the University of Southampton starting from September 2016.</p>

<div class="content-title">My Interests</div>
<div class="content-body">
    <p>I have been using Windows all my life but after using Ubuntu 9.04 in 2009, I have had an interest in trying out various Linux distributions, because of what variety there is between them. I have the intent on eventually using it as my main operating system, due to the advantages it has over the Windows platform. </p>

<p>One of my main interests in computing for the past few years has been in servers. Here I have experimented with various pieces of software on both Windows and Linux, such as configuration management, DNS, E-Mail etc. Soon I will begin to venture into other areas of networking such as routing and VLANs.</p>
<p>I also have experience in a wide variety of programming languages, including: HTML, CSS, PHP, Pascal, Java and Javascript.</p>
