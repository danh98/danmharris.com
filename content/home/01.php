	<p>Hello, my name is Dan Harris and I am an 18 year old technology enthusiast. I have had an interest in computing for the last 8 years and am planning to pursue a career in the industry. I have just completed studying A-Levels in Computing, Maths and Physics where I got results of A*A*A respectively. I also have an AS in Further Maths and Geography (Both at A grade). These results have earned me a place on a Computer Science course at the University of Southampton starting from September 2016.</p>
