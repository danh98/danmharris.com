	<p>As part of my A2 computing course I had to independently design, build and test an application for a real end user. My project was an Android app written in Java which allows members, sessions and expenses of a bowls club to be managed. This is the largest project I have done to date and allowed me to explore many features of object oriented programming and android as a development platform.</p>
	

<p>The app is available for download at http://danmharris.com/downloads
