    <p>This project was originally conceived as a means of integrating a blog with my current website design, without having to incorporate a third party Content Mangement System (CMS). The main goal of this project is to have a few simple methods that a web designer can add to their web page to add a fully functional blog with a backend administration panel.</p>

	<p>As part of my A2 computing course I had to independently design, build and test an application for a real end user. My project was an Android app written in Java which allows members, sessions and expenses of a bowls club to be managed. This is the largest project I have done to date and allowed me to explore many features of object oriented programming and android as a development platform.</p>
	

<p>The app is available for download on my <a href="./downloads">Downloads</a> page.
