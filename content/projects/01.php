    <p>This project was originally conceived as a means of integrating a blog with my current website design, without having to incorporate a third party Content Mangement System (CMS). The main goal of this project is to have a few simple methods that a web designer can add to their web page to add a fully functional blog with a backend administration panel.</p>
